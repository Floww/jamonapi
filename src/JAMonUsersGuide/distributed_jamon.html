<h2 align='center'>Using JAMon to monitor distributed applications</h2>


<!-- START JAMON SPECIFIC HTML -->


            <p>Modern software is often distributed.  An application might have multiple web servers, message brokers, a distributed file system and more.
                This makes detecting performance problems and determining application health difficult.
                JAMon 2.78 has improvements that make monitoring distributed applications easier.   </p>

                <p>Here is a video that demonstrates running distributed JAMon in both jetty and tomcat</p>


               <p> With previous versions of JAMon it was only possible to view JAMon statistics separately on each host where JAMon was installed.
                   JAMon now allows developers to centrally view the JAMon data of ALL JVMs from any JAMon web application.
                   The ability to view statistics of a distributed application from a central location is invaluable.  This same capability can be used
                   to view multiple applications that your organization has even if they resided on different servers. </p>

                <p>Developers can provide their own implementations too. JAMon implements this capability with a new interface (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/main/java/com/jamonapi/distributed/JamonDataPersister.java">JamonDataPersister</a>) which is called from a timer.
                    A <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/main/java/com/jamonapi/distributed/JamonDataPersister.java">JamonDataPersister</a> implementation enables a developer to do anything they want with
                    the serializable JAMon data (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/main/java/com/jamonapi/MonitorComposite.java">MonitorComposite</a>).
                    JamonDataPersister has three primary methods: put, get, remove. They are used to save, retrieve, and delete JAMon data associated with a specific server.
                    </p>

                <p>JAMon ships with the ability to save the monitoring data to a distributed <a href="http://hazelcast.org/">HazelCast Map</a>.
                    By default the data will be saved every 5 minutes.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://hazelcast.org/">HazelCast</a> implementation will automatically be called if the HazelCast jar is found in the classpath
                    (The java class that implements this is  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/main/java/com/jamonapi/distributed/DistributedJamonHazelcastPersister.java">DistributedJamonHazelcastPersister</a>).
                    This implementation puts a serialized version of JAMon data into a HazelCast distributed HashMap.
                    The server hostname/port will be the key, and the serializable JAMon data as the value.
                    The JAMon web application can display data from any host by selecting the servers key from a select box from jamonadmin.jsp.</p>

            <p><ul>Developers can easily implement JamonDataPersister and perform their own actions on JAMon data.  A few examples follow:
                 <li>Persist the data to a distributed NOSQL database, or file store such as Cassandra, or Hadoop.</li>
                 <li>Persist the data to an in-memory key/value database such Reddis.</li>
                 <li>Persist the data to a flat file, so in the even of a server crash JAMon data is still available.</li>
                <li>The DistributedJamonHazelcastPersister class replaces each servers saved data each time the 'put()' method is called.
                    This isn't required though.  Another option would be to keep snapshots (i.e. not just one copy of the data).</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>HazelCast has other powerful capabilities that developers can take advantage of.  For example you could use HazelCast to filter JAMon records
                across all servers (say looking for a certain exception type), or to run map/reduce jobs on the JAMon data. </p>

            <p>To change the save frequency (defaults to 5 minutes) or to change the use your own JamonDataPersister either put <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jamonapi/jamonapi/ci/master/tree/jamon/src/test/resources/jamonapi.properties">jamonapi.properties</a>
                in your classpath, or provide command line arguments when you invoke your program (Example: -DdistributedDataRefreshRateInMinutes=2 -DjamonDataPersister=com.steve.MyPersister).
                Command line properties take precedence over the properties file.</p>

            <p>See your jvm, and container documentation for more information about where the  jamonapi.properties file can be placed.</p>
