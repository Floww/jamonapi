# jamon properties that allow for configuration of how jamon will run. http://www.jamonampi.com
# The file should be put in your applications classpath.  That location will vary depending on what software container
# you are working with.
#
# For tomcat8 both the jamon jar, hazelcast.xml and this file were placed in:
#   ...apache-tomcat-8.0.8/lib/jamonapi.properties
# For jetty9
#  ...jetty-distribution-9.2.1.v20140609/resources/jamonapi.properties
#
# Note: pathnames need to be escaped: path=c:\\docs\\doc1
#  Note: command line properties take precedence over anything in this file.
#   Example:  -DdistributedDataRefreshRateInMinutes=2 -DjamonDataPersister=com.steve.MyPersister
#   Jetty Example: java -DdistributedDataRefreshRateInMinutes=1 -jar start.jar OPTIONS=All

# Indicates how often should jamon trigger the save event in minutes
distributedDataRefreshRateInMinutes=5

# Class that initiates saving of MonitorComposite (serializable).
# The class must implement com.jamonapi.distributed.JamonDataPersister
jamonDataPersister=com.jamonapi.distributed.DistributedJamonHazelcastPersister
